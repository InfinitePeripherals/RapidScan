RapidScan is an innovative product bringing the power of backend services directly to the Halo without the need for frontend Android development. RapidScan will forward barcodes or camera image (+the selected action) to the appropriate backend services using Bluetooth, BLE, WiFi+REST, or WiFi+MQTT for processing. These services can then respond with a "card" describing what to display on the Halo's screen using a simple markup language called RiSL (Ring Scanner Language).

*This is a "NO HALORING DEVELOPMENT NEEDED" path.*
